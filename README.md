# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

A Prework study guide to help students keep track of notes for HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. Keeping track of new different subject can be overwhelming, I built this guide to help keep all the important information in one place which aids students like myself to keep track of key information. By building this project I learned the basics of setting up a project (from setting up a GitHub account, to setting up a local environment to work on my projects and most importantly link these two. I also learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.)

Each section in this project contains notes about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
